        <p>HeiChips carries on the <a href=https://fpga-ignite.github.io/>
                FPGA-Ignite Summer School </a> series as we are now looking into
                microelectronics much beyond just FPGAs (which was a focus in
                the first three issues).</p>

	    <p>HeiChips is a one-week opportunity for networking, exciting lectures and a hackathon on designing a custom chip <b>(that will be subsequently taped-out on the IHP 130nm BiCMOS Open Source PDK)</b></p> 
           
	    <p>The HeiChips Summer School is kindly supported by <a
                href=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en>Heidelberg

                and <a href="https://www.chipdesign-germany.de/en/">Chipdesign
                    Germany</a>. <b>Attending the event and all social activities is free of charge</b>. However, participants have to arrange travel and accommodation on their own.
	    
	    <p>The free and open-source hardware (FOSH) community has achieved remarkable progress over just the last few years and we have now an ecosystem that is growing fast in ease-of-use, quality and features. HeiChips will address this with classes covering a wide spectrum of topics, including PDK design, analog and digital design but also pad-ring design and everything that is required for a successful tapeout. </p>

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <!--section id="instructions-section" class="wave-animation">
	    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
	    <p> The virtual machine image contains all the required software for the summer school. Here, you can find the instructions on downloading and installing Virtual Machine software like VirtualBox and KVM/QEMU as well as the corresponding VM-images.</p>

	    <h5>Quick notes on the installation of Virtual Machines (Virtual Box and KVM/QEMU)</h5>
	    <ol>
		    <li><h4> Virtual Machine Software (Host)</h4>

            The virtual machine (VM) image is available in VDI-format for VirtualBox and QCOW2-Format for KVM/QEMU.
            
            If you have already VirtualBox or KVM/QEMU installed, continue to (2).
            
            Decide which virtual machine software to install. If unsure, use VirtualBox (easier installation).
            
            Download VirtualBox for your system here:
	    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Download links for VirtualBox</a> (Install and follow the instructions in the link provided).</li>

            
	    <h5>Link for the Virtual Machine Images:</h5>
            The VM-image is available in two formats. You need only the one that fits to the virtual machine software that you installed.
	    The Virtual Machine image is compressed in 7zip format and available as a Virtual Box Image (VDI) and KVM (QCOW), get it here:
            
	    <br>Compressed KVM VM-image:</h6> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/w1grfcv5zhyitpwg1jcuw/summer_school_2024.qcow2-Hiko.7z?rlkey=eikp90srp7mzcotrgzlcpclyl&dl=0" target="_blank">KVM link</a>
	    <br>Compressed VDI VM-image:</h6> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b5xlqjrock0hmgvulak3i/summer_school_2024.vdi-Hiko.7z?rlkey=7jyd377ioueiwaavf63n0ini1&dl=0" target="_blank">VDI link</a>

		    <li><h4>Extract Virtual Machine</h4>
	    The VM needs to be extracted before starting. If you haven't 7zip installed, install it using the appropriate binary provided in the package (linux, macos, windows, 32- and 64-bit). You can download 7-zip from here: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">Download links for 7-zip</a>
            
	    Then extract the image using 7zip. </li>
            
            
		    <li><h4> Start Virtual Machine</h4>
            
			    Using the virtual machine software you chose, create a new virtual machine wich has at least Two CPUs and 20GB of RAM (more is better), and open the corresponding image. Then, start the virtual machine and you should see the Debian-system booting to the graphical login screen.  Done!<br>To log into the VM use:
			    <br><b>Username:</b> user
			    <br><b>Password/root password:</b> FPGAIgnite </li>
            </ol>

    <!-- Tools -->
    <section id="tools-section" class="wave-animation">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>While we will provide a virtual machine (or actually
                two) bundling all necessary tools,
                you can also install the tools natively.
                For this we recommend a Linux-based system. On Windows you can
                also use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Some tools can
                also be run natively on Windows and MacOS, but make sure you
                have all tools in the same environment, since there can be
                dependencies between them. This list will be
                updated until HeiChip 2025 starts, so check for
                updates from time to time.

            <h5>OSS CAD Suite</h5>
            OSS CAD Suite is a binary software distribution for a number of open source software used in digital logic design.
                <li><a href="https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build?tab=readme-ov-file#installation"
                    target="_blank">Installation</a> </li>
            <h5>FABulous</h5>
            FAbulous is a framework for building (embedded) FPGAs.

            </br></br>


                A prerequisite for FABulous is Python version 3.12 (and the
                aforementioned OSS-CAD-Suite). While following the installation
            instructions, make sure that you check out the dev branch <b> after
            </b> the
            cloning step:</br></br>
            <div class="terminal">$ git checkout FABulous2.0-development (after
                cloning!)</div>
            </br>

            <li><a
                href="https://fabulous.readthedocs.io/en/fabulous2.0-development/Usage.html"
                    target="_blank">Installation</a> </li>
            <li><a
                href="https://github.com/FPGA-Research/FABulous/tree/FABulous2.0-development"
                    target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> </li>
            <h5>LibreLane</h5>
            LibreLane is an ASIC infrastructure library, which we will use during the <b>LibreLane Lab</b> and the <b>hackathon</b>.
            The final chip is also created using LibreLane.<br>
            
            It is recommended to install LibreLane using <b>Nix</b>. Nix is a package manager that allows you to install all tools natively, but manages the dependencies for you.<br>
            LibreLane is available natively for Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and macOS (x86_64, aarch64). For Windows, you can use virtualization such as WSL2.<br>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>
              <a href="https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/common/nix_installation/index.html" target="_blank">Installation</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/librelane/librelane" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>
            </li>
            
            <br>
            
            To test your correct installation of Nix, please run the following snippet:<br><br>
            
            <div class="terminal">$ nix run github:librelane/librelane/dev -- --pdk ihp-sg13g2 --smoke-test</div><br>
            
            This will run LibreLane using Nix, set up the IHP Open PDK, and implement a simple macro. If this is successful, your setup is complete.
            
            <h5>FABulator</h5>
            FABulator is the graphical frontend of FABulous. It can be used to explore fabrics generated by FABulous.
            <li><a
                href="https://github.com/FPGA-Research/FABulator?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started"
                    target="_blank">Installation</a> </li>
            <h5>IIC-OSIC-TOOLS</h5>
            IIC-OSIC-TOOLS (Integrated Infrastructure for Collaborative Open
            Source IC Tools) is an all-in-one Docker container for
            open-source-based integrated circuit designs for analog and digital
            circuit flows.</br></br>

            For our purposes you just need to follow Section 4 of the README
            (<code>Quick Launch for Designers</code>) on the IIC-OSIC-TOOLS
            GitHub Repo:

            <h5>Chisel</h5>
            The <b>Constructing Hardware in a Scala Embedded Language</b> (Chisel) is
            an open-source hardware description language (HDL) used to describe
            digital electronics and circuits at the register-transfer level that
            facilitates advanced circuit generation and design reuse for both
            ASIC and FPGA digital logic designs.</br></br>

            For our purposes you just need to follow the <code>Quickstart</code> section of
            the instructions, which uses the Scala CLI. Make sure to source
            <code>~/.profiles</code> (depends on your platform, check the console output!)
            after installing the Scala CLI (step 1).

Emigrating Embedded Software Security into Modern Emerging Hardware Paradigms </td>

For such systems, it is very difficult to install additional software level security on top of the main program because of the space crunch. Hence our approach is to design a secure hardware along with an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) such that the software becomes inherently
secure in memory, even when designed using a fundamentally memory-unsafe programming language like C or C++. In order to achieve this, we are implementing a tagged memory along with an extended RISC-V ISA (an approach similar to CHERI) on an existing RISC-V Virtual Prototype, that can simulate the behavior of memory starved embedded systems. </td>

Conventional phase-comparison monopulse is subject to estimation ambiguities, especially in the case of a large baseline distance. In contrast, the proposed frequency-comparison monopulse leverages the time-to-frequency mapping property of LFM signals, enabling unambiguous DoA estimation for any antenna spacing. By leveraging a fully digital generation method for LFM signals implemented on the ZCU111 FPGA platform, we carry out an validation test of the frequency-comparison monopulse, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of conventional monopulse </td>

	    <td> MemSim+: Realistic Behavioral Model for ReRAMs Capturing Non-Idealities </td>
            <td> Memristors are promising candidates for in-memory computing systems, offering a potential solution to the von
Neumann bottleneck in traditional computing architectures. Designing reliable and efficient memristive circuits re-
quires accurate simulation models that can reflect real-world device behaviors, including their inherent non-idealities.
In this talk, I will present MemSim+[1], a comprehensive behavioral model for memristors that captures both cycle-to-
cycle (C2C) and device-to-device (D2D) variations in key parameters, such as high and low resistance states, threshold
voltages, resistance drift, and switching dynamics. Unlike traditional models that rely on fixed values of key parameters
[2,3,4,5,6], MemSim+ accounts for statistical distributions of these parameters—derived from extensive experimental
data—to emulate real device variability. The model’s universality is validated using two types of memristors: SDC
(Self-Directed Channel) and ECM (Electrochemical Metallization) devices. Electrical characterization was conducted
on different SDC and ECM devices to capture D2D variability, while repeated measurements were performed on one
device of corresponding technology to capture C2C variations. To more accurately emulate real-world non-idealities
in memristor behavior, MemSim+ employs clipped Gaussian and multi-Gaussian approaches—going beyond the tra-
ditional use of simple Gaussian distributions. These advanced statistical fitting techniques allow the exclusion of
critical outlier ranges and provide a more accurate representation of key parameter variations. As a result, the Mem-
Sim+ model captures the full spectrum of device variability more effectively, including memristance, resistance drift,
threshold voltage, and switching dynamics.
To demonstrate the impact of this variation-aware modeling, MemSim+ was used in circuit-level simulations of two
stateful logics: IMPLY logic and FELIX-OR logic. The design constraints of these circuits depend on technological
parameters as well as non-idealities of the memristor in that technology. Hence, a variation-aware circuit-technology
co-design is crucial for maximizing the correct functionality of conceptual circuits. As the result, variation-aware
circuit-technology co-design can significantly enhance the correctness probabilities of the IMPLY logic gate circuit,
achieving correctness probability up to 88.75% (↑ 3.00%) for SDC technology and 85.75% (↑ 4.25%) for the ECM
technology. Additionally, for the FELIX OR gate, the correctness probabilities increase to 85.75% (↑ 35.25%) for SDC
technology and 84.00% (↑ 10.50%) for the ECM technology. The findings indicate that the typical simulation approach
(using nominal values) leads to lower chances of the fabricated circuits functioning as expected. The results showcase
the significance of circuit-technology co-design and their co-dependence, as well as the importance of considering
non-idealities in the behavior of real devices when designing memristive circuits and systems. </td>

	    <td> A Highly Linear Wide Bandwidth Programmable Gain Amplifier in 0.18μm CMOS Process </td>
            <td> Programmable Gain Amplifiers (PGAs) are fundamental to optimising signal dynamic range in systems such as medical electronic devices, telecommunications, and disk drives. In automatic gain control (AGC) systems, PGAs help maintain consistent signal levels under varying signal strengths, requiring a wide dB-in-linear gain range. However, modern analogue front-ends demand not only wide gain control but also high bandwidth, low power consumption, compact area, and good noise performance.
This project presents the design of a CMOS PGA targeting a gain range of –12 dB to 20 dB, bandwidth of 100–500 MHz, distortion ≤ –55 dB, and power consumption ≤ 25 mW. The initial implementation uses an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) with series and feedback switch-resistor networks. Both conventional folded cascode (FC) and recycling folded cascode (RFC) amplifiers were explored. While the RFC provided improved open-loop gain and gain-bandwidth product over the FC, the closed-loop bandwidth remained limited to 1–2 MHz — far below the target.
The current implementation achieved a figure of merit (FoM) of 1187 MHz·pF/mA, and closed-loop bandwidth was extended by a factor of 100 due to feedback. However, redesign is needed to meet the bandwidth requirement. Future work proposes a current operational amplifier based on the second-generation current conveyor (CCII), leveraging current-mode techniques to achieve high speed and low power operation. This approach, when implemented with high-speed IHP BiCMOS technology, is expected to meet the performance targets for wideband, low-power PGAs in modern systems. </td>

            <td> Universal quantum computing requires a scalable system with millions of qubits.
Realizing fast, high-fidelity readout remains a central bottleneck, particularly when
striving for scalable architectures that minimize spatial overhead, wiring density, and
energy consumption. To address these limitations, we present our activities on
development of integrated circuits at cryogenic temperatures. Especially an integrated readout circuitry implemented in a 22 nm FD-SOI technology. This IC will be connected to a Single Electron Transistor (SET). The prototype is made for reading out two SETs. It implements a high-speed mode for single-bit readout, enabling rapid discrimination between
the│0〉and │1〉state, as well as a high-resolution mode for tuning, which amplifies the signal and passes it to the room-temperature electronics. We characterize this IC inside a closed cycle Gifford-McMahon cryostat at a temperature of 6 K. The measurement shows a power consumption of 33.6 μW/SET for the single-bit readout and 216 μW for the high-resolution mode. With the correlated double sampling with times of 2×1 μs, the circuit shows low noise of 223 pA (1σ) for single-bit readout, while the high-resolution mode has an input-referred noise level of 188 pA RMS (10 Hz to 1 MHz).
The IC advances scalable, integrated readout solutions and marks a critical milestone on the path toward universal quantum computing </td>

	    <td>  Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising technologies for building large-scale quantum computers. However, scaling these systems from a few qubits to thousands or more requires a fundamental rethinking of how we control them, especially when it comes to delivering precise magnetic flux to each qubit.
Today, this is typically done using room-temperature DACs that generate analog signals routed through long, lossy cables into the cryostat. This approach is not scalable. The flux DACs quickly become the limiting factor, consuming too much power, space, and wiring bandwidth as the qubit count increases.
SCALLOP focuses on solving this problem first, by designing low-power, high-precision DACs and associated sequencer logic that operate directly at cryogenic temperatures (~4K), close to the qubits themselves. To make this possible, SCALLOP uses a fully open-source ASIC design flow, making the development transparent, collaborative, and accessible. These DACs are being developed using the new cryo-compatible PDK from IHP, a BiCMOS process specially tailored for operation at low temperatures and high frequencies, ideal for integration with superconducting qubit systems.</td>

The B+HCCES module operates at a 300 MHz sampling frequency using an embedded phase-locked loop, and achieves a throughput that is 3.33 times greater than leading state-of-the-art TRNGs, while maintaining a compact hardware footprint. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated random sequence passes both the NIST SP800-90B and BSI AIS-31 test suites, confirming the reliability and quality of the B+HCCES TRNG for cryptographic and security applications.    </td>

                    <p>It was really hard for the judges (<em><a href="#krzysztof-id">Krzysztof Herman </a></em> and <em>Joscha Ilmberger</em>)
                        to pick a specific project for the best project award and the competition was very tight with many cool and well executed projects.
                        However, two projects stood slightly out due to their completeness (including testing) and engineering effort and it was decided
                        to split the HeiChips Best Project award among:</p>

                   <h3>Dirk Koch</h3>
		   <p> Dirk Koch is an expert in FPGA technology. His group maintains the FABulous open-source eFPGA framework and various other FPGA-related projects.</p>
		   <p>His class will briefly introduce the basic concepts of eFPGAs and the FABulous framework.
We will then investigate the methods of using ISA subsetting, hardened custom instructions, reconfigurable custom instructions and software emulated instructions. We will also learn in particular how reconfigurable custom instructions can be made available in a CPU core. With this knowledge, we will run a lab where we will define a custom eFPGA eFPGA and implement custom instructions on that fabric using the open-source tools Yosys and nextpnr.</p>
